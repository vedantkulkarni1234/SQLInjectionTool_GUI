# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

The Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to identify potential vulnerabilities in a given website. It performs a series of checks and generates a comprehensive report outlining any detected issues. This tool utilizes several libraries for HTTP requests, HTML parsing, and PDF report generation.

## Features

- **Scan Web Pages**: Analyze web pages for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Generate Reports**: Create detailed reports in PDF format.
- **Customizable Scans**: Define custom scanning parameters and settings.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-scanner.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd vulnerability-scanner
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python scanner.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter the URL of the website you want to scan.

3. Review the generated PDF report located in the `reports/` directory.
